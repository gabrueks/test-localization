<h1>Hello!</h1><h3>~~English~~</h3>

Node.js + Typescript + MongoDB

The **Typescript** helps in your .js projects to be more
To start, you should clone the repository using the following command: <br>
``` git clone https://github.com/gabrueks/test-localization ```
<br>

<h3>Now that we have the code on our machines</h3>
There are two options on running the template, locally or in containers docker (wich is also locally, but it's different, you know). I used docker-compose to run a **MongoDB** instance and a **Node.js** server without problems.

<h3>Now, go to your project folder</h3>

To run in docker, you have two options

1: by Makefile (Unix systems)
Run the command:
```
make
```

2: By docker-compose, run the command:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

To run locally, you need to run **MongoDB** on your machine an run the commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
